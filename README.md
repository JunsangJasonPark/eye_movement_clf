# eye_movement_clf

This is my personal practice repository for develpoing eye movement classification algorithms.

Please understand the inclination of my redundant comments. It was so hard for me to understand more profesionals' code while developing this classifier because I am an outlander of any STEM field.

So I tried to be as specific as possible for other students, researchers, or developers who are endeavoring to develop their own classifier.

Thank you.
